# Rails Pre-Work

We have only a few short weeks together - in an effort to get to the real heart of the subject, I'm going to ask that you complete some preliminary work on your own before class starts.

## Get on the Team

Create a Github account and send me your account name so that I can add you to the class organziation. In many ways, your Github _is_ your resume, so treat it as such -

* Your username should be professional, something like your actual name
* Include a picture of yourself

Once you've created an account, [email me](mailto:jamesdabbs@gmail.com) your username so that I can add you to the class organization.

## Watch for Updates

Spend a moment investigating "watching" settings on Github. I'll be posting several specific assignments here in the coming days, so be sure to keep an eye out.
