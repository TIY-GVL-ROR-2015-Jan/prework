# Ruby Prework
### Greenville Q1 2015

_James Dabbs (james@theironyard.com)_

We've got [a lot](https://dgosxlrnzhofi.cloudfront.net/custom_page_images/64/page_images/Rails_Competencies.png?1386276348) to cover and only a few short weeks to do so. I'm going to ask that you complete some preliminary work, so that we can establish a common starting point and spend class time focusing on things that are most difficult to learn on your own. That said, feel free to contact me with questions - learning how to ask for help is a very important skill.

These assignments won't make you a Ruby master (if they could, I wouldn't be here) - but they will make sure that you've got a good foundation to build on, and are ready to make the most out of the course. Importantly, this work will assure me that you

1. can self-direct progress on technical projects
2. have been exposed to the key technologies and workflows that we'll be using in class
3. can communicate difficulties and accomplishments clearly
4. have reflected on your learning style

Point 2 is not "have internalized every nuance", but I will expect you to at least be _familiar_ with e.g. `git` and the terminal - you're likely to feel lost out of the gate otherwise.


## Requirements

Review and complete the tasks below by **December 29th**. Any deliverables should be emailed to me by then. If you have any questions, please email - I'll be glad to help (though expect some good-natured shaming if you're pushing the deadline).

You will need to sign up for Treehouse to complete some of these tasks. Treehouse is free for 14 days (which should be more than enough to finish the required work), and $25/month after the trial.


## Setup

### Install OSX Yosemite (if you haven’t already)

* You'll need to sign in to the Mac App Store with you Apple ID. If you don't have one, [sign up here](https://appleid.apple.com/).
* Download the Yosemite upgrade from the Apple Store: [download here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12).
* Double-click "Install OS X Yosemite” to begin installation.

WARNING: The OS X upgrade can take a bit of time to complete and will require a restart. Plan on doing this in the evening or over a lunch break.

### Install a text editor

As a developer, you spend most of your time reading, writing, and editing code, so it's no surprise that a text editor is one the most important tools to familiarize yourself with. I won't prescribe a particular editor, but would recommend one of the following:

* Sublime Text 3 - Pro: fully featured, very snappy, excellent package ecosystem. Con: non-free.
* Atom - Pro: similar to Sublime, free. Con: can be sluggish, especially to open.
* Ruby Mine - Pro: integrated Ruby-aware features (code completion, method lookups). Con: non-free, heavyweight.
* Vim - Pro: powerful modal editor, works in a terminal, ubiquitous. Con: steeeeep learning curve.

I use Vim myself, but won't be requiring it (learning Vim can distract too much from learning to code) - though you will likely see it and Sublime in lectures. Regardless of which editor you decide to use, spend some time familiarizing yourself with it (customizing and learning shortcuts, for instance). Mastering the tools you use every day will always pay dividends.


## The Command Line

The command line will be our primary interface to the computer, and aside from your editor, the place you will spend the most time. If you've never opened up a terminal before, now is the time to start getting comfortable.

* (Optional, but recommended) Install and use iTerm2 as your terminal
* Read http://skillcrush.com/2012/12/03/command-line-2/
* Go through the Treehouse course on [Getting Started with the Console](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#getting-started-with-the-console)
* Go through the Treehouse course on [Users and Permissions](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#users-and-permissions)
* Go through the Treehouse course on [Environment and Redirection](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/console-foundations#environment-and-redirection)
* Read and practice with [A Command Line Primer for Beginners](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything)


## Typing

Believe it or not, a **lot** of time in the first weeks of programming is spent fixing simple typing errors. It would not be ridiculous to suggest that many of you will spend 12-24 hours (or more) fixing typing errors during class.

If you don't know how to touch type (i.e. type without looking at the keyboard), try to spend some time each day working on touch typing (you can try http://www.keybr.com/). If you already know how to touch type, I would highly recommend working through the Rails lessons on http://typing.io. Typing for programming is actually a good bit different than everyday typing, so getting some practice in could potentially save you a ton of time the first few weeks of class.


## Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Developers use such tools both to track their own work as it changes over time, and to collaborate with other developers on larger projects. I use Git on _every_ non-trivial project I work on, and this class will be no different.

Again, the objective is not to become an expert before the class, but just to start to get comfortable with the concepts and vocabulary. We'll continue to work with Git throughout the course and cover some of the more advanced concerns in class.

1. Go through the Treehouse course on [Git Basics](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/git-basics)
2. If you want to spend some more time with git, [Git immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) is a great resource.


## GitHub

GitHub is a website which hosts Git repositories. We will be hosting all of our class projects on GitHub, and it will likely be the center of your open-source world for some time to come. In many circles, your Github profile _is_ your resume, and it should be created with that in mind:

1. Sign up for a GitHub account at https://github.com/ - something professional, if not exactly your name
2. Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name
3. Email me the username you choose so that I can get you added to the group we'll be using for class
4. Check out the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) if you want to learn how to use GitHub prior to class.


## HTML / CSS

At the end of the day, our applications will be responsible for producing HTML and CSS. That said, we will be covering them rapidly, as many people are familiar with them from past experience. Especially if you are not, you should take some time to familiarize yourself with these foundational technologies.

1. Complete the [Codecademy HTML & CSS course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web)

(Treehouse has some additional material that you can check out, though it goes into more depth than I'd expect you to work through on your own.)

This class is primarily concerned with data flow and functionality over design, so a little bit of extra CSS experience can really help you stand out and make your projects look significantly more polished.


## Ruby

We'll cover Ruby from square one in class, but many of the concepts can take repeated exposure before sinking in. So, you don't really want your first exposure to be in lecture.

1. Start the [Codecademy Ruby course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby). Work through at least "Arrays & Hashes", but feel free to go farther if you'd like.


## Reflection

Good job! Take a step back and reflect on where you are. Did you enjoy any assignments in particular? Struggle with any? How are you feeling about the upcoming class? Excited? Nervous? How do you learn best? How can you maximize the value you get out of this course? Do you anticipate any problems? If so, how can we work to avoid them? Where do you want to be in 3 months? 12?

1. Write up your reflections and either send them to me via email.

We'll be encouraging this sort of reflections throughout the course - if you feel comfortable sharing publicly, this would be a good time to start a blog and post them there.
